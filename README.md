![Analog joustick](https://github.com/MitrophD/Swift-SpriteKit-Analog-Stick/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true)

### Features
- Begin handler 
- Tracking handler
- Stop handler
- Set/change joystick diameter
- Set/change stick && substrate colors
- Set/change stick && substrate images

### Manual
1. Just drop the **AnalogJoystick.swift** file into your project.
2. That's it!

### Init examples:
***init with 100px diameter.Colors & images you can change later***
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameter: 100)
// or
let joystick = ðŸ•¹(diameter: 100)
```
***Substrate has 100px diameter, stick has 50px diameter***
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameters: (100, 50)) 
```
***init with 100px diameter.Substrate has blue color, stick has yellow color***
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameter: 100, colors: (UIColor.blue(), UIColor.yellow()))
```
***init with 100px diameter.Substrate has "substrate" image, stick has "stick" image***
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameter: 100, images: (UIImage(named: "substrate"), UIImage(named: "stick")))
```
***init with 100px diameter.Substrate has blue color && "substrate" image, stick has yellow color && "stick" image***
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameter: 100, colors: (UIColor.blue(), UIColor.yellow()), images: (UIImage(named: "substrate"), UIImage(named: "stick")))
```
***init with substrate && stick diameters.Substrate has blue color && "substrate" image, stick has yellow color && "stick" image***
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameters: (100, 50), colors: (UIColor.blue(), UIColor.yellow()), images: (UIImage(named: "substrate"), UIImage(named: "stick")))
```
***init with substrate && stick diameters.Substrate has blue color, stick has yellow color***
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameters: (100, 50), colors: (UIColor.blue(), UIColor.yellow()))
```
***init with substrate && stick diameters.Substrate has "substrate" image, stick has "stick" image***
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameters: (100, 50), images: (UIImage(named: "substrate"), UIImage(named: "stick")))
```

### Designated initializator
``` swift
init(substrate: AnalogJoystickSubstrate, stick: AnalogJoystickStick)
```
**WHERE:**
- **substrate** - substrate of joystick (AnalogJoystickSubstrate:AnalogJoystickComponent)
- **stick** - stick of joystick (AnalogJoystickStick:AnalogJoystickComponent)

### Convenience initializators:
``` swift
convenience init(diameters: (substrate: CGFloat, stick: CGFloat?), colors: (substrate: UIColor?, stick: UIColor?)? = nil, images: (substrate: UIImage?, stick: UIImage?)? = nil)
convenience init(diameter: CGFloat, colors: (substrate: UIColor?, stick: UIColor?)? = nil, images: (substrate: UIImage?, stick: UIImage?)? = nil)
```

### Typealias
``` swift
typealias AnalogJoystick = ðŸ•¹
```
## Example
``` swift
let joystick = ðŸ•¹(diameter: 110) // it's equal let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameter: 110)
```

### Handlers
- var beginHandler: (() -> Void)? // before move
- var trackingHandler: ((AnalogJoystickData) -> ())? // when move
- var stopHandler: (() -> Void)? // after move

### Computed Properties
- var stickColor: UIColor (get/set)
- var substrateColor: UIColor (get/set)
- var stickImage: UIImage? (get/set)
- var substrateImage: UIImage? (get/set)
- var diameter: CGFloat (get/set)

## Examples
### Create joystick
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameter: 100) // you can set images/color later
```
**or with images**
``` swift
let joystick = AnalogJoystick(diameter: 100, images: (UIImage(named: "substrate"), UIImage(named: "stick")))
```
### Tracking With Closure
``` swift
joystick.beginHandler = { [unowned self] in
  // Something...
}

joystick.trackingHandler = { [unowned self] data in
  // Something...
  // data contains angular && velocity (data.angular, data.velocity)
}

joystick.stopHandler = { [unowned self] in
  // Something...
}
```
### Change diameter
``` swift
  joystick.diameter = 100 // set new diameter
```
### Change colors
``` swift
  joystick.stick.color = UIColor.yellow() // set yellow color to stick node
  joystick.substrate.color = UIColor.red() // set red color to substrate node
```
### Change images
``` swift
  joystick.stick.image = UIImage(imageNamed: "yourStickImage") // set image to stick node
  joystick.substrate.image = UIImage(imageNamed: "yourSubstrateImage") // set image to substrate node
```
